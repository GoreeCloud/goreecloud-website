The immutable 1.1.0 Stable source has one known CSS import-closure defect:
glaze-v1.components.css imports a nonexistent glaze-v1.candidate.css. Until a
corrected immutable Stable release is published, Website builds fail closed on
that exact defect and remove only that single dangling import from the generated
artifact. Any other upstream drift remains a hard failure.
